# Wizard of Oz LLM Project

## Overview
Hey there! Welcome to my Wizard of Oz (baby) LLM (so, small language model? ;)) Project. This is a simple experiment where you input a starting phrase, and the model predicts what comes next. Sometimes it's coherent, sometimes not, but it's always interesting!

## How It Works
I created this using a basic language model setup. You feed in a phrase, and based on its training, the model tries to predict the next words. It's like asking a wizard to tell you the next part of a story you've just started.

## Keeping It Real
Let's be honest about what this project can and can't do:

- **Hit or miss:** The generated sentences can be mixed â€” sometimes they make sense, other times, they're just random.
- **Expect surprises:** It's unpredictable, which can be part of the fun or the frustration.
- **Just the basics:** This project is a straightforward example of a language model, meant for educational and experimental use.
